# Advent of Code 2021

Have no hopes of me completing this AoC. Just started with 1 and 2 and happened to solve them successfully so trying out 3 and maybe 4... and maybe so on.

### To run:

- open terminal
- clone the repo
- `elm repl`
- whichever day you want to check, import that file. eg, if you want to run Day 1, `> import Day1 exposing (..)`
- `run1` for the first part of the day's puzzle
- `run2` for the second part of the day's puzzle
